# Description
I developed this classic Snake game for an assignment during my 3rd semester of the Computer Science major at ELTE Faculty of Informatics (fall 2024).
The game is built in Java and uses a MySQL database to save player scores. The controls are WASD, and the goal is to collect apples (red circles) while skillfully avoiding the rocks (gray squares).

# Setup
Create the relevant table via the *snake_db.sql* file (located in the sql folder) for the database. You can set the connection properties in *HighScores.java* (located at ./src/main/java/snakegame).
